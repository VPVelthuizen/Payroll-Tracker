# Payroll-Tracker

I am creating a repository to track employee names as well as their salaries. It will also display the average salary as well as a random employee in the console.

This repository will be stored on Github and can be accessed at https://vpvelthuizen.github.io/Payroll-Tracker

This repository does not require any installs or special equipment to access, only a web browser.
